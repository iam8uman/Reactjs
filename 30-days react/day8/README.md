## What i learned from this EP18?
@codevolution

## useReducer()
-used for state management (wait what ? for state management we already have useState ?)

-exactly it is an alternative of useState in better way.

JS have reduce() method in array and imporoved version of this is the useReducer

##----------------------------------------

Not much but I just learned the concept of reduce methods in js and its replica on reactjs. 
Important 2 things
** useReducer(reducer,initialState) // takes 2 parameter **
** reducer(currentState,action) // which also takes 2 paramter **

useReducer returns 2 values i.e. newstate,dispatch

## Remember it is alternative of useState for state management.
